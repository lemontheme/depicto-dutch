plan of action (2-03-2016)
==============

1. fill out customization questionnaire on http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/customize/matrix.cgi
    - use 'choices' files in current mini-dutch grammar and original fokkens file
    - assume SVO order for the time being
    - keep it simple
    - add a few lexical entries
2. try parsing with resulting grammar
