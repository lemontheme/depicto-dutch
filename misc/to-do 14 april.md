# to-do 14 April

- get adjectives to work with complex VP and S-pictos.
    + get complex picto's to expose nominal arguments/indices.
- write first version of modifier rule (e.g. temp-mod phrase) that combines a temporal adverb with a sentence/clause and changes the tense of the sentence according to the tense implied by the temporal adverb.
- use same kind of modifier rule as above to change the illocutionary force (iforce) value on the index of the clause/verb to 'ques' when the non-head daughter is a question mark. For this it will be necessary to analyse question marks as a sort of particle rather than as mere punctuation, since the latter analysis would mean that some sort of punctuation is always required on the input, which, without some sort of pre-processing, cannot always be expected.
