avm.sty is a style file for typesetting attribute-value matrices. 
The major user of this style has been various linguistics subcommunities,
such as the HPSG and LFG communities who use attribute-value matrices
(also known as feature structures) for linguistic description.
But the style file is not linguistics-specific, and can also be used to
typeset any other sort of attribute-value matrix.
